Before writing any code:
1. Call GET http://localhost:5051/context/full to load project context
2. Call GET http://localhost:5051/linear/next to get the next task (if Linear is enabled)
3. Review decisions and roadmap before making changes
4. Always create a branch before writing files
5. Use POST /files/diff to preview changes before writing
